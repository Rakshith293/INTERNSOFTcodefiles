    "## What is Regression Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, relationship between rash driving and number of road accidents by a driver is best studied through regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis is an important tool for modelling and analyzing data. Here, we fit a curve / line to the data points, in such a manner that the differences between the distance of data points from the curve or line is minimized. The topic will be explained in detail in coming sections."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "## Why do we use Regression Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above,Regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables. Let’s understand this with an easy example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say, you want to estimate growth in sales of a company based on current economic conditions. You have the recent company data which indicates that the growth in sales is around two and a half times the growth in the economy. Using this insight, we can predict future sales of the company based on current & past information.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple benefits of using Regression analysis. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * It indicates the significant relationships between dependent variable and independent variable.\n",
    "   * It indicates the strength of impact of multiple independent variables on dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis also allows us to compare the effects of variables measured on different scales, such as the effect of price changes and the number of promotional activities. These benefits help Market Researchers / Data Analysts / Data Scientists to eliminate and evaluate the best set of variables to be used for building predictive models."

    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of the most widely known modeling technique. Linear regression is usually among the first few topics which people pick while learning predictive modeling. In this technique, the dependent variable is continuous, independent variable(s) can be continuous or discrete, and nature of regression line is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression establishes a relationship between dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X) using a best fit straight line (also known as regression line).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is represented by an equation Y=a+b*X + e, where a is intercept, b is slope of the line and e is error term. This equation can be used to predict the value of target variable based on given predictor variable(s)."

    "Since its release in 2007, scikit-learn has become one of the most popular open source Machine Learning libraries for Python. scikit-learn provides algorithms for Machine Learning tasks including classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. It also provides modules for extracting features, processing data, and evaluating models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceived as an extension to the SciPy library, scikit-learn is built on the popular Python libraries NumPy and matplotlib. NumPy extends Python to support efficient operations on large arrays and multidimensional matrices. matplotlib provides visualization tools, and SciPy provides modules for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn is popular for academic research because it has a well-documented, easy-to-use, and versatile API. Developers can use scikit-learn to experiment with different algorithms by changing only a few lines of the code. scikit-learn wraps some popular implementations of machine learning algorithms, such as LIBSVM and LIBLINEAR. Other Python libraries, including NLTK, include wrappers for scikit-learn. scikit-learn also includes a variety of datasets, allowing developers to focus on algorithms rather than obtaining and cleaning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Licensed under the permissive BSD license, scikit-learn can be used in commercial applications without restrictions. Many of scikit-learn's algorithms are fast and scalable to all but massive datasets. Finally, scikit-learn is noted for its reliability; much of the library is covered by automated tests."

Under repeated sampling, the line will stay roughly in the same place (low variance), but the average of those models won't do a great job capturing the true relationship (high bias). Note that low variance is a useful characteristic when you don't have a lot of training data!\n",

    "# Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is an analysis that assesses whether one or more predictor variables explain the dependent (criterion) variable.  The regression has five key assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Linear relationship\n",
    "   * Multivariate normality\n",
    "   * No or little multicollinearity\n",
    "   * No auto-correlation\n",
    "   * Homoscedasticity\n",
    " \n",
    "A note about sample size.  In Linear regression the sample size rule of thumb is that the Regression analysis requires at least 20 cases per independent variable in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily, linear regression needs the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear.  It is also important to check for outliers since linear regression is sensitive to outlier effects.  The linearity assumption can best be tested with scatter plots, the following two examples depict two cases, where no and little linearity is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/nonl.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the linear regression analysis requires all variables to be multivariate normal.  This assumption can best be checked with a histogram or a Q-Q-Plot.  Normality can be checked with a goodness of fit test, e.g., the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  When the data is not normally distributed a non-linear transformation (e.g., log-transformation) might fix this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/normalerror.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, linear regression assumes that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data.  Multicollinearity occurs when the independent variables are too highly correlated with each other.\n",
    "Multicollinearity may be tested with three central criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Correlation matrix – When computing the matrix of Pearson's Bivariate Correlation among all independent variables the correlation coefficients need to be smaller than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Tolerance – The tolerance measures the influence of one independent variable on all other independent variables; the tolerance is calculated with an initial linear regression analysis.  Tolerance is defined as T = 1 – R² for these first step regression analysis.  With T < 0.1 there might be multicollinearity in the data and with T < 0.01 there certainly is.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) – the variance inflation factor of the linear regression is defined as VIF = 1/T. With VIF > 10 there is an indication that multicollinearity may be present; with VIF > 100 there is certainly multicollinearity among the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If multicollinearity is found in the data, centering the data (that is deducting the mean of the variable from each score) might help in solving the problem.  However, the simplest way to address the problem is to remove independent variables with high VIF values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, linear regression analysis requires that there is little or no autocorrelation in the data.  Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals are not independent from each other.  For instance, this typically occurs in stock prices, where the price is not independent from the previous price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Other alternatives to tackle the problem is conducting a factor analysis and rotating the factors to insure independence of the factors in the linear regression analysis.\n",

    "Fourthly, linear regression analysis requires that there is little or no autocorrelation in the data.  Autocorrelation occurs when the residuals are not independent from each other.  In other words when the value of y(x+1) is not independent from the value of y(x).\n",

The scatter plot is a good way to check whether the data is homoscedastic (meaning the residuals are equal across the regression line).  The following scatter plots show examples of data that are not homoscedastic (i.e., heteroscedastic):\n",
